  <h1>Hey What's Up You Guys, Yes!!<h1>
  	<p> So...this is my website!! Glad you found it I guess. If anything typed on here doesn't make sense, it's slimpy because my brain is fried after my PSAT today. For example, I had to type that last sentence 4 times before I actually got it right.</p>

  	<p> I could really go for an iced coffee rn, then again, I'm always in the mood for iced coffee so..oh well.. I really don't even know what I'm typing rn.. I'm sure I'll change it later, and I'm pretty sure that this is now officially a run-on sentence. lol byeeeee</p>

  	<p> (also did y'all catch that typo up there?? lol I'm weak)</p>
